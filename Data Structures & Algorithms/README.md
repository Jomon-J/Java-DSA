# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

This repository is a comprehensive collection of important **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** concepts, curated for students, developers, and coding enthusiasts preparing for interviews or honing their problem-solving skills. Each topic includes concise explanations and well-structured code examples for quick reference.

## Key Features
- Structured code examples for each DSA concept.
- Focus on **clarity**, **efficiency**, and **real-world applications**.
- Indexed topics with seamless navigation.
- Includes boilerplate code for easy implementation.

This section focuses on the core DSA topics with practical examples and problem-solving techniques.
